    description: "I am Front End Designer based in Virginia, I am deeply passionate about creating engaging online experiences.",
    description2: "My journey in web development and design began during my high school years, where I challenged myself to build a mini to-do list page. Through watching numerous tutorial videos, I successfully crafted the page and gained a solid foundation in web development and design (HTML & CSS). Since then, I have been dedicated to designing and developing responsive websites and web applications from scratch. In my projects, I leverage various technologies, tools, and languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT JS, Bootstrap, Figma, and VS Code to bring my designs to life.",
    description3: "I am always eager to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web development. Browse my portfolio to see my latest creations and get in touch if you're interested in working together!"
